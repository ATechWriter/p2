I referred to the following resources:

[PHP Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/) - syntax, how to use functions
[ASCII Table](http://www.asciitable.com/) - looked up ASCII values for "Add a symbol" option
[W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.org/) - checked details of form tags/attributes (HTML) and learned how to check if the user had clicked the submit control yet
