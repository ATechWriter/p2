## Citations

I referred to the following resources:

* [PHP Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/) - syntax, how to use functions
* [ASCII Table](http://www.asciitable.com/) - looked up ASCII values for "Add a symbol" option
* [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.org/) - checked details of form tags/attributes (HTML) and learned how to check if the user had clicked the submit control yet

Also, my thanks to classmates at Piazza for pointing me to the `isset()` command.
